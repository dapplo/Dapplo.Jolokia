# Dapplo.Jolokia
A simple project, based on Dapplo.HttpExtensions, to access the Jolokia REST API (see: https://jolokia.org/)

An example is included which shows how to connect, query MBeans with operations and attributes, and used them.

The UI, created with https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts, will show the heap memory usage over time (10 seconds interval), and supply a garbage collect button.
