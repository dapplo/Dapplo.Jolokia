# Dapplo.Jolokia
A simple project, based on Dapplo.HttpExtensions, to access the Jolokia REST API (see: https://jolokia.org/)

An example is included which shows how to connect, query MBeans with operations and attributes, and used them.

The UI will show the heap memory usage over time (10 seconds interval), and supply a garbage collect button.
